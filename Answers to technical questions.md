Answers to technical question
============

*How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.*

**The coding test took me 45 minutes. 

I would improve the design of the detail view for the users also I'd improve the string of the "updated at" to give the user a clear date and I would organize the code better and checked the used functions to make better the system response. 

I would add a task list to check all the requirements asked before the start of the code development.**


*What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.*

**The use of Data Tables because it organize the data and brig function like searching and sorting and it's easy to implement.** 

~~~javascript
$('#table-devices').DataTable({pageLength: 25, responsive: true, });
~~~


*How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?*

** I would comment and uncomment every section of the code to find where it's the function or the line that is wrong. Yes, I have done it.**



*How would you improve the Knetik APIs that you just used?*

**The APIs have a perfect function, at first look I wouldn't change anything but I would need to review the code to check if it's secure and I would use appropriate POST and GET values.**


*Please describe yourself using JSON.*
